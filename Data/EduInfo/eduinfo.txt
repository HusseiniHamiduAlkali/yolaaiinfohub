I. Overview of Education in Yola and Adamawa State

Adamawa State, with Yola as its capital, has a diverse educational system encompassing various levels. The state government has shown commitment to improving education through various policies and initiatives.

    Policy Focus: The Adamawa State Government aims to provide access to quality education for its citizens, with policies centered on access, equality, and educational standards.

    "Free Education" Policy: Introduced in 2019, this policy aims to remove financial barriers to education, such as school fees and the cost of supplemental materials, to increase access and promote universal enrollment.

    Learning Outcomes: Despite efforts, learning outcomes remain a significant challenge. UNICEF data (2021) indicates that only a small percentage of primary school pupils in Adamawa State possess foundational literacy and numeracy skills.

    Low Learning Outcomes: A pervasive issue across primary and secondary schools, with many students not achieving foundational literacy and numeracy.

    Inadequate Funding: Insufficient budgeting for educational facilities and programs.

    Poor Infrastructure: Deteriorating or insufficient school buildings, lack of libraries, laboratories, and basic amenities.
