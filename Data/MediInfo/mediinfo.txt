The healthcare system in Adamawa State, with Yola at its core, operates on a three-tier structure:

    Primary Health Care (PHC): The first point of contact for communities, focusing on preventive, promotive, and basic curative services. These are typically dispensaries, health posts, and primary health centers.

    Secondary Health Care: Provided by general hospitals and specialist hospitals, offering more specialized medical and surgical care.

    Tertiary Health Care: The highest level of care, offered by teaching hospitals and federal medical centers, providing highly specialized services, advanced diagnostics, research, and medical training.

General Statistics (Adamawa State Context, relevant to Yola):

III. Public Health Services and Initiatives

    Adamawa State Ministry of Health: Pivotal in addressing health needs, especially of vulnerable populations. Focuses on improving public health outcomes through various initiatives.

    Collaboration: Works with international partners (e.g., Global Affairs Canada) to strengthen healthcare initiatives.

    Focus Areas:

        Tuberculosis and HIV (particularly among internally displaced populations).

        Community wellness programs.

        Educational programs on health.

        Designing health service delivery systems.

        Policy and regulatory initiatives.

    Modibbo Adama University Teaching Hospital's Public Health Department: Actively involved in health awareness, monitoring community health, identifying prevailing health issues, immunization, health education (WASH, exclusive breastfeeding, complementary feeding), child health (birth registration, growth monitoring), Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STI) unit, and disease surveillance.

    National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS): Attempts to expand healthcare access, but challenges exist with penetration, with a significant portion of the population (over 90%) remaining uninsured and relying on out-of-pocket expenses. MAUTH, for example, has an NHIS unit.

    Poverty and Health: High poverty rates in Adamawa State (75.45% as per one source) pose a significant challenge to health outcomes, impacting food and nutritional security, and the ability to afford medications.

IV. Health Challenges and Gaps in Yola/Adamawa State

Despite efforts, the healthcare sector in Yola and Adamawa State faces significant challenges:

    High Mortality Rates:

        Infant Mortality Rate: 120/1,000 live births (compared to North Eastern average of 109/1000).

        Under-5 Mortality: 222/1,000 live births.

        Maternal Mortality Ratio: Between 1,100 – 1,500/100,000 live births (significantly higher than the National average of 547/100,000).

    Inadequate Infrastructure: Many health facilities are dilapidated, poorly equipped, and lack basic amenities like consistent power and water supply (as reported in some rural cottage hospitals, which can reflect broader issues).

    Manpower Shortage and Quality: Critical shortage of professional healthcare workers, leading to overcrowding and longer waiting times.

    High Cost of Medications and Treatment: Despite government efforts, patients often struggle with the high cost of drugs and services, leading to out-of-pocket expenses and many unable to afford necessary care.

    Low Coverage of Key Interventions: Low rates of:

        Use of insecticide-treated nets (2% in children and pregnant women).

        Skilled attendants at birth (15%).

        Delivery in a health facility (11%).

        Full immunization coverage (19%).

    Poor Funding and Logistics: Insufficient funding for programs, low capacity at state and LGA levels to implement health promotion activities, and poor availability of funds and logistics for high-impact health interventions.

    Patient Satisfaction Issues: While overall patient satisfaction with services (e.g., at MAUTH under NHIS) might be "good" on some metrics (like environment/cleanliness at 87.9%), significant dissatisfaction exists with the availability of prescribed drugs (lowest at 48.2%), staff attitude, and waiting times.

    Impact of Insurgency/Displacement: Yola, as the state capital, has been a refuge for internally displaced persons (IDPs) from conflict-affected areas. This influx puts additional strain on existing healthcare services, and IDPs often have unmet psychosocial and health needs due to limited access to services and direct exposure to violence.
