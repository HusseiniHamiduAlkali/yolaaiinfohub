You're looking for community information about Yola, specifically regarding its wards and their proximity. This is crucial for understanding the social and administrative fabric of the city.

Yola is generally divided into two main urban areas, which are also distinct Local Government Areas (LGAs):

    Yola North Local Government Area (LGA): This largely encompasses Jimeta, which is the commercial and administrative hub of Yola and Adamawa State.

    Yola South Local Government Area (LGA): This includes the "Old Yola Town" where the Lamido of Adamawa's palace is located, representing the traditional heart of the city.

Here's a breakdown of the wards within these LGAs and their proximity:

I. Yola North Local Government Area (Jimeta)

Yola North LGA consists of 11 wards. Jimeta is the core of this LGA. These wards are generally urban or semi-urban and are relatively close-knit, forming the bustling commercial and administrative center.

Wards in Yola North:

    Alkalawa

    Ajiya

    Doubeli

    Gwadabawa

    Jambutu: This ward is known to be where Yola International Airport (Wuro Jabbe) is located, making it a key entry point.

    Karewa: A significant area within Jimeta.

    Limawa

    Luggere

    Nassarawo

    Rumde: This area is significant as some major roads, like the ongoing construction of the 20.8 km Super Highway, connect to Rumde.

    Yelwa

Proximity and Key Features of Yola North Wards:

    Centrality: Wards like Karewa, Nassarawo, and those around the Jimeta Modern Market are considered central and highly commercial.

    Jimeta Market: A major landmark, drawing people from all over Yola and beyond, acting as a central point of activity. Wards surrounding the market would be in close proximity to this commercial hub.

    Airport Proximity: Jambutu ward directly contains the airport, making it an outer but crucial part of Jimeta.

    Residential and Commercial Mix: Most wards in Yola North will have a mix of residential areas, shops, small businesses, and government offices.

    Road Network: Jimeta has a relatively developed road network compared to some other parts of Yola, with ongoing and completed road projects aimed at improving connectivity within and between wards (e.g., roads in Bachure, Karewa, Nassarawo Borehole, Scope Road, Jambutu Street, Togo Street, Lekki Taba Street, Mambila Street).

    Strategic Location: Its role as the state capital means it houses many key institutions, making the wards within it strategically important.

II. Yola South Local Government Area (Old Yola Town & Environs)

Yola South LGA also consists of 11 wards. This area represents the older, traditional part of the city and its surrounding more rural or peri-urban communities. It's generally less densely populated and commercialized than Jimeta.

Wards in Yola South:

    Adarawo

    Bako: This ward is significant as the INEC office for Yola South LGA is located at Yola Bye-Pass adjacent to Aliyu Mustapha College, Bako Ward.

    Bole/Yolde Pate: This area is getting a boost in infrastructure with the construction of the Nyibango-Yolde Pate road (3.185km with 2 span bridges), which is intended to serve as the first bypass linking Yola (South) to Jimeta (Yola North). Also, Bole extension road has been completed.

    Namtari

    Ngurore: This is a notable town within Yola South, known for its livestock market and being a significant transit point.

    Makama 'A'

    Makama 'B'

    Mbamba

    Mbamoi: This ward includes areas like Kofar Wali Dahiru, near Lamido's Palace, indicating its close connection to the traditional center.

    Toungo (Note: There is also a Toungo LGA further south in Adamawa, so be careful not to confuse the ward with the LGA if the context isn't clear.)

    Yolde Kohi

Proximity and Key Features of Yola South Wards:

    Traditional Core: Wards like Mbamoi, close to the Lamido's Palace, form the historical and traditional heart of Yola.

    Benue River Proximity: Being on the Benue River, some wards in Yola South would have access to riverine activities.

    Rural-Urban Fringe: As one moves away from the old town center, wards in Yola South transition into more rural or peri-urban settings with agricultural activities.

    Connection to Fufore: Yola South LGA borders Fufore LGA, and roads like the Yola Bye-Pass often connect these areas.

    Infrastructure Development: Roads like the Bole extension road and the Nyibango-Yolde Pate road highlight ongoing efforts to improve connectivity within Yola South and link it more effectively to Jimeta.

III. General Proximity and Relationship between Yola North and Yola South

    "Twin Cities": Yola (referring to the old town in Yola South) and Jimeta (in Yola North) are often referred to as "twin cities" due to their close geographical proximity and intertwined development.

    Distance: Jimeta is approximately 5-9 km (3-5.5 miles) northwest of Old Yola Town.

    Main Connectors: The main roads and infrastructure connect these two LGAs, facilitating movement between the administrative/commercial hub and the traditional/residential areas. The aforementioned "first bye-pass road linking Yola to Jimeta" (Nyibango-Yolde Pate) is a prime example of this connectivity.

    Transportation: Keke NAPEP (tricycles), taxis, and public buses (including the new palliative buses) regularly ply routes connecting various wards within both Yola North and Yola South.
