LOCAL DATA

Stop button not properly implemented in Home, Edu, Eco, Agro, Community, Navi, Servi and Medi sections. It is not aborting the request and the proper message is not displayed that the user aborted the request.

Edu Ai not working

Chat history functionality: implement for every section and let the history clean with a clean refresh of the app but not after rendering a section (e.g. not after moving from Edu to Eco or back to Home).
