Analyse each .section4 edit and add information in the <p> and the alt="" to Match the <h3> of any .section4 in Community section.

if the user cliked the back button on the detail page. I want to ensure the section for which the user is seeing a detail page, is loaded and the user is reverted back to the point at which they clicked the "learnmore button".

3. style the AI message to be left-aligned and not always centrealised like  how it is.

STYLE : camra capture & stop recording button (onCapture)

LOCAL DATA

Stop button not properly implemented in Home, Edu, Eco, Agro, Community, Navi, Servi and Medi sections. It is not aborting the request and the proper message is not displayed that the user aborted the request.

Edu Ai not working

Chat history functionality: implement for every section and let the history clean with a clean refresh of the app but not after rendering a section (e.g. not after moving from Edu to Eco or back to Home).
