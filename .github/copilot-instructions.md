This project is a responsive multi-page web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each main section (Home, EduInfo, AgroInfo, MediInfo, MapsInfo, CommunityInfo, AboutInfo) is a separate page/component with its own CSS file. There is a Data folder for each section's data (including images). The app features a top navbar that becomes a hamburger menu on mobile. Each section has an AI chat area (with Gemini API placeholder), and FAQ lists (except Home and MapsInfo). Home page includes AI chat, camera capture, microphone recording, and file upload options, all styled inline. MapsInfo page includes a chat for directions (Google Maps API placeholder) and map display. All UI is modern and responsive.
