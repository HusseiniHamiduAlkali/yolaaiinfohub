            <h2>About the Initiative</h2>
            <p>This community health initiative focuses on the mass distribution of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) to households across Yola. Malaria remains a significant health challenge in the region, and the use of treated mosquito nets is one of the most effective and low-cost ways to prevent infection. This campaign is a collaborative effort between the government, local health agencies, and international partners to reduce malaria-related morbidity and mortality, especially among children and pregnant women.</p>
