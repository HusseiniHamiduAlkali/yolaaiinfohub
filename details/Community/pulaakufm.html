            <h2>About Pulaaku FM</h2>
            <p>Pulaaku FM 95.3 Yola is a unique radio station dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the rich culture, history, and language of the Fulani people. "Pulaaku" is the ancient code of conduct and ethics that defines Fulani identity, encompassing virtues like patience, discipline, and respect. Our station serves as a cultural repository and a modern platform for celebrating this deep heritage, connecting Fulani communities across Adamawa and beyond.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to provide high-quality, culturally resonant programming primarily in the Fulfulde language, while also broadcasting in other local languages to foster inter-ethnic understanding. We aim to educate a new generation on the importance of their roots, from traditional music and poetry to the time-honored practices of animal husbandry and agriculture.</p>
